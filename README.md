run npm install in both frontend and backend folders to install dependencies.
type npm start in directory frontend/task-manager-app
dont forget to run the server as well.
to run the server go to the folder backend and type npm start if u already have nodemon.
if not  install nodemon by typing npm i nodemon then run npm start.
HAVE FUN!!
